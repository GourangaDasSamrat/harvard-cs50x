The listener’s audio aura could be described as energetic and upbeat, based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top songs. The songs suggest a preference for lively and positive music.

This calculation may not be very representative because it treats all songs equally, even though some songs may have been played more often than others. It also ignores changes in listening habits over time. A better approach would be to weight songs by play count or analyze trends across different time periods.
