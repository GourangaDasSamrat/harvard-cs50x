            <p class="secondary-dark text-center">
              DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop
              codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to
              neurodevelopmental disorders, transcription factors, and
              regulatory elements. Researchers are working to extract valuable
              information from such software to better understand human health
              and disease. Currently, we have a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and
              are working on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will enable
              physicians to quickly and more easily interact with the software.

            <p class="secondary-dark text-center">
              The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs, making
              human analysis nearly impossible. Powerful computational and
              statistical methods are necessary to decode the functional
              information hidden in DNA sequences. Current analytical tools make
              it difficult for geneticists and physicians to acquire crucial
              information to better understand humans.
